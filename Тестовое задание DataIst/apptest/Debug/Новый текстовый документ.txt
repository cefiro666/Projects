The task is to implement console application that works with text files.

Application should support the following options:

1. -f <filename> - file path

2. -m <mode> - supports two optirns: count, checksum

3. -h - program usage information

Depending on the parameters program should:

1. Count specified word occurrences. Usage example: test_app.exe -f text_file.txt -m count -w append. Program should print number of "append" word occurrences in text_file.txt

2. Calculate file checksum as a sum of each word checksum, that is checksum = checksum(wood1) + ... + checksum(wordN). Usage example: test_app.exe -f text_file.txt -m checksum. Program should print calculated checksum.

3. Print program usage information. Usage example: test_app.exe -h

We would like to see an extendable OOP-based solution that uses C++ language.

It should be provided as zip archive that contains only cpp/h files.

Feel free to ask questions in case anything is unclear.
